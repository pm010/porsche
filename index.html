  <p>On to the next stage.
    Performance, robust technology and endurance are what count in rallying. Only then do you really have a chance of being the first to reach the finish line. The new 911 Dakar is a sports car that is just as suitable for offroad driving as it is for on-road performance and also cutting a fine figure in the city.The current Porsche model range includes sports cars from the Boxster roadster to their most famous product, the 911. The Cayman is a coup√© otherwise similar to the Boxster. The Cayenne is Porsche's mid-size luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV). A high performance luxury saloon/sedan, the Panamera, was launched in 2009.In July 2017, Porsche installed its first 350 kW, 800V charging station, which the upcoming Porsche Mission E will use. As of 2017, the Porsche charging station is the fastest electric vehicle charging station in the world, being able to charge a Porsche Mission E up to 80% within 15 minutes. Porsche is also currently working with other manufacturers to make Porsche charging stations compatible with other electric vehicles.In August 2018, Porsche announced that the formerly named Mission E electric car will be named "Taycan" meaning 'leaping horse.The prototype electric car is expected to be revealed in 2019 after its completion.</p>
